## About

Crosslink is a PWA that enables users to forward a link from their phones to their dekstop machine.

Just don't take it too seriously. This was just me experimenting with PWAs.

## Setting up the API

1. On your PC, visit https://github.com/pukmajster/crosslink-api and download the Crosslink API.
3. (OPTIONAL) You can change the default port in the ENV file if you so wish
4. Execute ```npm run dev``` to run the api. 
5. Your API should now be ready!

## Setting up the PWA
1. On your mobile deive, visit https://pukmajster.github.io/crosslink and download the Crosslink PWA.
2. On your PC, figure out your IPv4 address
3. In the Crosslink app, enter the IPv4 address of your PC along with the port the API is running on (example: 192.168.0.xxx:3000) and click 'SAVE IP'
5. That's it, you're now fully set up!
